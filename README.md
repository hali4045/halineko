additionally requires one o-ring wrapped around the pcb and plate assembly to be mounted. here are mcmaster links for [50a](https://www.mcmaster.com/1173N502/), [70a](https://www.mcmaster.com/9452K362/), and [90a](https://www.mcmaster.com/5308T317/). if mcmaster doesn't work for you, then you need a 1/8" width o ring with 262 dash number in your hardness of choice.
